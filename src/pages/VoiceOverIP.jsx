        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
        VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) transmits voice calls over IP networks using an internet connection instead of traditional telephone lines. These systems convert analogue voice signals into digital data by compressing sound into smaller packets, which are then transmitted over an IP network to devices such as smartphones, computers, and tablets.
            <br /><br />
            For businesses, VoIP allows call routing through a secure, internet-connected data centre, removing the need for physical hardware on-site. This internet-based solution is straightforward to install, with no initial connection fees, and offers easy maintenance and upgrades. Its flexibility ensures the system can expand with your business and provides robust call management features.
            <br /><br />
            Cloud-hosted IP phone systems offer reliability that conventional phone systems often lack. For businesses that depend on call tracking, support for hybrid work environments, and detailed call analytics, adopting IP telephony is an excellent way to enhance operational efficiency and reliability.
